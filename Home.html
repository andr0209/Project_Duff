                <h3> A little about me...</h3>
        
        <p>
            My name is Mike and I like to eat and drone on and on about the stuff that happens in the Ottawa bubble. I have been doing it for a number of decades and I think it qualifies me to sit in the chamber of sober second thought and have the power to reject and amend legislation passed by elected representatives of the people of our country. 
        My folsksy ways inspire confidence among certain segment of electorate and I can be very useful as a bagman for whomever would choose to appoint me to the Red Chamber. I am completely devoid of any political convictions (or any others for that matter), therefore my previous unfortunate association with Steve H. need not be considered a hindrance. 
        If appointed, I promise to verify all the future expenses with a designated party-hack in order to prevent any future controversies.
            Hope that you will find it in your heart to forgive and forget.
